    "I’m a regular Computer Science student, who just finished his second year at a UK University. I got here because of my parents, who wanted all the best for me, like any other parent would. For this, however, they spent nearly all of their life savings on this tuition."
    "\n~We wanted the best; you know the rest~"
    "\nI’d say that my personality is more introverted, than extroverted, but I’d rarely decline offers to socialize with close friends. Things I do dislike are parties and hangouts with people I don’t know. Getting to know those people causes me discomfort, which is why at occasions like that I can come off as quiet and talk only with my friends. I could sit in my little corner with my computer all day, completely forgetting about a world existing outside of it. Of course, sitting alone all day is also not a thing I particularly enjoy. I need to get in contact with a friend at least once a day, be it over the internet or any other way, or I might simply die of boredom. When I did have to talk with strangers, whether it was to establish connections or talk to friends of friends, I made myself look like an arrogant, yet talkative young man. This was done to not look like I’m completely antisocial or incommunicative."
    "\nThe first year at university I completed with relative success, since back then computers interested me a lot, and I wanted to dive deeper into their workings. Time passed and so did the first year, after came the long-awaited summer, and then I was back on the land of the Empire, over which the sun never sets. The longer I spent over my studies, the more disappointed I became in my abilities and course selection. If in the first year I could get by using general knowledge, resourcefulness and basic computer savviness, come year two programming seemed like hellish torture, where I could understand nothing. Having mentally grouped that task as uninteresting I found myself often neglecting practical tasks given to me by the University. The only thing I paid semi-regular attention to were lectures, which I attended regularly. Day-by-day, raindrop by raindrop, information that I was supposed to solidify in my mind piled up and snowballed out of proportion. With every task, every coursework my enthusiasm for learning slowly diminished. When time came for deadlines, I found a way to catch up and complete my work, though none of it gave me any enjoyment and wreaked havoc on my nervous system. It is sure to happen again when that time comes around again in Year 3."
    "\nThis takes us to current day. It’s June 2020. I waste most of my time at my computer. Either due to a lack of things to do in quarantine, or from laze, which prevents me from completing domestic tasks that I should’ve done long ago. My worthless mornings get spent playing a multitude of mods from the Steam Workshop for Everlasting Summer. Later, I do insignificant breaks to make and consume food, after which I return to my “throne” and spend time with my similarly lazy friends, playing online games until late evening. The last stage of my daily content consumption occurred in bed, where I read “Lucifer” comics on my phone before going to sleep. The next day that process repeated. This is what brought me to writing this story."
